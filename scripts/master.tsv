Introduction to Mathematical modeling and Optimization using Python	The content slides aren't available now, but will be updated in due time.Convex Optimization and related literature can be found here : convex optimizationCvx-opt Literature can be accessed from here: cvx-opt-user-guide	"This tutorial attends to the concepts of mathematical modeling and optimization.
In an era where mathematical programming and machine learning are increasingly intertwined, optimization
finds strong relevance. This workshop will discuss how to mathematically model real world problems and solve
them using optimization tools in python.Machine learning researchers have embraced the advances in mathematical programming
allowing new types of models to be pursued [1][2]. Mathematical programming puts a premium 
on accuracy, speed and robustness. Future novel machine learning models and novel 
optimization models will only continue to grow with advancement of time.Generally, optimization includes finding best available values of some objective function
given a defined set of constraints. This field of study comes under the field of 
Operational Research (OR) methods, with a wide range of problem solving techniques use to
improve decision making and efficiency. The areas of such application lies in financial engineering,
marketing, revenue management to transportation problems.  We will also discuss area where
optimization finds application in machine learning scenarios and possible limitations.
As part of beginner material, we will model using Linear Programming (LP) method and solve our modeled problem using convex optimization solver, cvx-opt.The workshop will be in two phases:How to mathematically model and use cvx-opt solver to model optimization problem as LP.Use the knowledge gained in 1. to real life problems.Using Python for Optimization:Python has numerous powerful solver packages for scientific computing. For this workshop
we will use the cvx-opt package, software package for convex optimization based on the 
Python programming language. Bibliography[1] Kristin P. Bennett and Emilio Parrado-Hernández. 2006. The Interplay of Optimization and Machine
 Learning Research. J. Mach. Learn. Res. 7 (December 2006), 1265-1281. [2] Sra, S. and Nowozin, S. and Wright, S.J. Optimization for Machine Learning, Neural information 
processing series, MIT Press, 2012."	"The attendees should have basic Python programming experience. Prior knowledge of optimization
is not required but good to have.The cvx-opt package needs to be pre-installed with the required dependency package as indicated on
the page.  Acquaintance with numpy and matplotlib package is a plus but not mandatory. "	"MS by Research, Graduate student, IIITB.My research area lies in large scale optimization and 
application to real world problems. My research work involved applying such methods to optimize
digital circuits, thereby creating Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools. Prior to my MS, I
have worked as an embedded design engineer for two years."	You can reach me on Facebook  and find me on Git	[]	2015	False
All Things *Py*	I have already given a variant of this talk at Chennai Python User Group . The slides can be found here	"The Python ecosystem is awesome. We have great tools and wonderful community that encourages people 
to learn and take pride in being a pythonista. Yet there are these small little questions that appears to be trivial but tend to create whole lot of confusion among beginners.Through this talk , I like to revisit some of these questions which everyone should be aware of.We look at questions such as..Other than discussing these questions, we will also do some python bytecode hacking  and  look at some really cool stuff under the hood."		Krishna Sangeeth , ahem myself is a software engineer at one of the IT companies in Chennai. He works mostly in hadoop ecosystem these days using technologies such as spark, impala etc. On his short career at IT he had the bad luck of working in technologies ranging from Fortran 77,  Mainframes to Bigdata technologies which on introspection makes him open to continuous learning. Among all the preachy things he often quotes, he sort of believe in the statement that A good programmer is always language agnostic and it's the solution that counts more than the tool.So he considers himself to be on a journey to become a good one . And Python is  something that he can't resist to put in his backpack for the  journey. 	Talks I feel good aboutMy random musings 	[]	2015	False
An introduction to Computer Vision using OpenCV-Python	Code:	Computer Vision is the process of extracting relevant information from an image or a set of images. Humans have the capability to see and interpret the environment around them. Computer Vision aims to impart a similar capability to machines, wherein they are able to take in data from the outside world and perform tasks accordingly. The data that they acquire is essentially a set of image frames from the camera. Computer Vision makes use of algorithms to work on these images, and interpret them as needed.Computer Vision is a powerful tool, with which we can create applications for gesture and facial recognition, OCR, and also extend this to give vision to robots.The most popular library that is used for Computer Vision is the openCV library. OpenCV also has python bindings that make use of python's 'numpy' module to implement its functions.The talk would be focussed on giving a basic understanding on how we can use the openCV-python library to implement basic computer vision and image processing algorithms. Some of the topics that would be covered in the talk are :We shall see how we can make simple and elegant applications that demonstrate these algorithms.To conclude, this talk is for those who are interested or want to start off with computer vision and image processing using python. 		I am a second year student of BMS College of Engineering, currently pursuing my undergraduate degree (BTech). I have been coding for 5 years now and I take a deep interest in competitive programming and python.	GitHub : https://github.com/Specas	[]	2015	False
Analyzing Python code with Pylint	The project pageBitbucket forgeDocumentationPresentation link	"Given the dynamic nature of Python, some bugs tend to creep in our codebases. Innocents NameErrors or hard-to-find bugs with variables used in a closure,
but defined in a loop, they all stand no chance in front of Pylint (http://pylint.org/).In this talk, I’ll present one of the oldest static analysis tools for Python, with emphasis on what it can do to understand your Python code.
Pylint is both a style checker, enforcing PEP 8 rules, as well as a code checker in the vein of pyflakes and pychecker, but its true power isn’t
always obvious in the eye of beholder, especially when it's hidden through its verbosity. Interpreting its results can be a daunting task,
but there are tricks which can be used to improve its user experience, such as enabling only structural checking with the -E flag or disabling
unwanted category checks.Pylint can detect simple bugs such as unused variables and imports, but it can also detect more complicated cases
such as invalid arguments passed to functions, it understands the method resolution order of your classes, generators, contexts managers and
what special methods aren’t implemented correctly.Starting from abstract syntax trees, we’ll go through its inference engine and we’ll see how Pylint understands the logical flow of your program and
what sort of type hinting techniques are used to improve its inference, including PEP 484 type hints.
Pylint's roadmap includes better understanding of Python code, by improving its flow control analysis, escape analysis, understanding metaclasses and descriptors
and having a better type checker, as well as improving the user experience, by reducing the number of false positives it currently has.
As a bonus, I’ll show how it can be used to help you port your long-forgotten library to Python 3, using its new –py3k mode,
which emits warnings regarding Python 3 compatibility.The talk overview will contain the following aspects:General architecture of Pylint:The types of bugs that Pylint can detect and how can we interpret the reports generated by it and what to focus on in the output for most effective static fixes on the code."	The participants should have a basic understanding of Python. No other prerequisite is necessary, since the other concepts will be explained during the talk.The following concepts will be explained during this talk:	"I'm an open source enthusiast coming from Romania. Lead maintainer of the Pylint project and on my way to becoming a CPython core contributor someday,
I'm also interested in language design, interpreters, static analysis and how languages work under the hood, as well as in building a community around a technology, being the founder of the biggest romanian Python group, RoPython."	Pylint contributionsCPython contributions	[]	2015	False
Analyzing arguments during a debate using Natural Language Processing in Python	The final deck which I am going to use in PyCon is now available on SlideShare at : http://www.slideshare.net/vicknickkgp/analyzing-arguments-during-a-debate-using-natural-language-processing-in-pythonA brief introduction to these topics can be found in the following links:	"This talk will guide you through the application of Python NLP
Techniques to analyze arguments during a debate and define a strategy
to figure out the winner of the debate on the basis of strength and
relevance of the arguments.Let’s take an example to explain it you :
Suppose that, you are discussing with your friend whether PyCon is popular in India or not. The discussion will start with you taking a stance for the topic (Let us assume that you believe, PyCon is popular in India). 
Then, the discussion can progress in four different ways:Through this talk, I will demonstrate how to detect each of these instances using NLP and also how to judge the outcome of this discussion (whether you have won it or not). This will focus on two main NLP techniques: Semantic Similarity and Sentiment Analysis, apart from the use of basic NLTK library functions.Python Packages to be used:I will explain some basic concepts before demonstrating their implementation in this tutorial. They include:"	Though I will be covering most of the basics, a prior experience will help you to easily grasp new concepts.

Architecting large volume streaming data solution in python.		Solutions developed for web, especially over social network have started seeing demand for large scale real time streaming data analytics.  This requires building applications on distributed platform that can scale, reliably process data without any loss, satisfy functional needs and at the same time meet the strict latency requirements .This talk aims at discussing use case for large volume streaming data analysis.

Automatic Data Validation and Cleaning with PySemantic	Here's a video that explains PySemantic in some detail (Note that it was meant for an audience of non-programmers): Slides will be available shortly.	Data is dirty. Any dataset that isn't properly curated and stored can suffer from many problems like having mixed data types, not being properly encoded or escaped, uneven number of fields, and so on. None of these problems are unsolvable. In fact, most of us are pretty good at cleaning data. Normally, when we know little or nothing about a given dataset, we proceed in a very predictable manner. We first try to read the data naively and see if errors are raised by the parser. If they are, we try to fix our function calls. When those are fixed, we try to run some sanity checks on the data, and end up filtering the dataset, sometimes quite heavily.The problem with this process is that it is iterative, and worse, it is reactive. Everybody in the team has to do it if they are to use the dataset. Sure, one can simply clean it up and dump it in a new file with just a few lines of code. But we shouldn't have to run that script every time we encouter a new dataset. We would be much more comforable if data is cleaned as it is read. It is much more efficient if data cleaning is a part of data ingestion. Secondly, and more importantly, cleaning data via ad-hoc Python scripts is non trivial. Readable as Python scripts might be, it's not always easy for everyone in the team to change the cleaning process. Moreover, there are no Python libraries that offer an abstraction at the level of cleaning and validating data.Therefore, if one has to go through the process of data validation and cleaning in a customizable, modular way, one has to make sure that:PySemantic is a Python module that automates all of this, and more. The purpose of this talk is to introduce this module and talk about the best practices of cleaning and validating data.

Automating your infrastructure and deployments with Fabric	For the demonstration purpose, We will deploy IRCMan (Built with python and node) which has a fairly complex architecture similar to that of this architecture	In my experience as a Full-Stack and DevOps Engineer, I have seen plenty of startups configure and deploy their applications manually. Most of those startups are not aware of Automated deployments (Or not aware of DRY principles for that matter). It is a time-consuming and error-prone process. And that madness has to stop. This workshop is focussed on solving that problem. We will be using a python library called Fabric. Fabric is not only for python, you can use it for Node / PHP or virtually any other language.  For the demonstration, I will try a deploy a fairly complex polyglot application built with both Python and Node. This is going to be a beginner to intermediate level worksop. At the end of the worksop, you will be able to automate your infrastructure and deployment. Be as much DRY as possible.		I am a Full-Stack and DevOps Engineer.

Avoiding common pitfalls of datetime from a webapp's perspective	Have already written a blog post related to Part 1 of the Talk: http://indradhanush.github.io/2015/03/23/dealing-with-datetime-objects-in-python/Any scripts used in the talk will be made available at Github.Final Slides: http://indradhanush.github.io/talks/pycon-india-15/slides.html	The datetime module is easily one of the most used standard libraries of Python. Yet, most of us struggle using it without hitting a snag or two, especially when one has to take care of multiple timezones. This talk is aimed at identifying such snags and how to fix them.This talk is divided into 2 parts. Part 1 deals with the datetime library itself, wherein the audience will get to know about the basic datetime types and common issues that crop up when dealing with datetimes across multiple timezones. It will also demonstrate the idea from a webapp's perspective. That is, how Postgres plays along with your webapp via Django. Knowledge of django is not a requirement as the same rules apply for any other web framework out there. It will be used just to explain the point in a more realistic context.Part 2 will deal with writing tests that depend on a specific time, for example, deleting all auth tokens older than 3 days.Introduction (2 min)Part 1 (20 min)Part 2 (7 min) If time permits the following will also be discussed:Q&A (10 min)	Basic familiarity with Python and the datetime module.

Building Games on Unity using IronPython		Unity 3D allows developers to build, test and deploy games at a faster pace. Indie games build by smaller team have become a crucial part of the gaming industry. Over numerous experimentation we found out many similarities in development and testing methodologies between these indie games and web applications. Still testing a game is tricky as it requires both Physics Engine Testing and Animation testing; so is deployment, as a game may  have a standalone or a browser-based client. Also while working on smaller projects like Unity plugins; we have discovered the optimal workflow for game development including testing and deployment. For a long time we used C# as our primary language and then moved on to UnityScript. But after a series late night hacks we were able to develop small game demos using IronPython on Unity Engine.

Building NextGen IoT solutions using Python and Cloud	We will be using this Github repo for the workshop.Also, if time permits, we will implement this on Galileo as well, where we will use this library to get started.The draft of this workshop is available in these slides.	In this workshop, we will use we will use Raspberry Pi B+  running Linux, connect various sensors to it – such as temperature, ultrasonic, and light sensor - and leverage the power of Python to push the sensor/IoT data on to the Cloud. In practical scenarios, the same setup can be extended to millions of devices through a number of different sensors. However, the bigger challenge resides in successfully collecting and analyzing the data from these devices in real-time. For this, we will leverage the power of Cloud to do real-time analytics. We will divide the entire walk-through into 4 main parts:•   getting started with Python on Raspberry Pi running Linux – 15 mins•   capture data from multiple sensors – 45 mins•   post the device data to cloud – 30 mins•   perform real-time analytics using Stream Analytics – 45 minsThe remaining time will be allocated for Q&As.Raspberry Pi is a single board computer, which is broadly used in the learning industry and creating prototypes. It's a pretty well known board due to its capabilities, and in addition to it, cheap cost. Time permits, we will also use another development board, Intel - Galileo for deploying the same code there. We would leverage Arduino Uno which would read sensor data and pass it on to the Raspberry Pi/Galileo. We would use Sparkfun Weather Shield (Sensor Kit) for the same, which is an Arduino compatible shield. We will use the Gateway Architecture, connecting Arduino to Raspberry Pi/Galileo which in turn will setup a secure Data communication with the cloud.Please read the prerequisites before coming to this workshop.

Building management frameworks for distributed systems using Python and SaltStack.		Deploying and managing distributed infrastructure software can be quite a challenging task for any systems administrator. New and complex, open source software systems are being developed in rapid succession. There is, hence, a crying need for simple and intuitive interfaces to mange such systems to make it easier for users and administrators that allow them to stay on top of such complex deployments.We will present our experiences in building one such unified management framework to manage a distributed file system based product infrastructure using Python and SaltStack. The talk will include our rationale behind choosing SaltStack and what it took to integrate its usage into our administration framework, resulting in a very simple interface to manage complex infrastructure.

Business Intelligence with Python	Rough plan for the proposed workshopSlides and Content for the workshop (Without codes, which will be added shortly)	This tutorial aims at introducing important concepts of Business Intelligence and Mathematical modelling to the targeted audience and opportunity for them implement their own BI systems in python. Business Intelligence may be defined as a set of mathematical models and analysis methodologies that systematically exploit the available data to retrieve information and knowledge which may be useful in supporting complex decision-making processes [1]. Implemented carefully and precisely, a business intelligence environment offers decision makers information and knowledge derived from processing data and through the application of complex mathematical models and algorithms. As a part of this tutorial, I will cover various options available in Python for ETL, mining data, data preparation, data exploration, regression (linear as well as time series) and applying classification algorithms like  SVM (Support Vector Machines), clustering algorithms on raw data in order to arrive at meaningful conclusions using various python libraries like NumPy, matplotlib, pandas, SciPy, scikit-learn and many more. Not just introduction to possibilities for implementing full fledged BI system in python, this session is meant to implement simple BI system on your own using python libraries. Also, as a part of this session, audience will be given brief introduction to the fields of data science and machine learning which includes implementing machine learning algorithms on various problems staged on online competition platforms like HackerRank and Kaggle; just to help them to learn different models used for Business Intelligent systems. [See content and slides]Towards the end, brief introduction to big data and pySpark has been added, so that audience will have slightest of hints on how to work with gigantic data!

Conda: cross-platform package manager	The content will be mainly bases on my experiences with working with conda and PyPI and knowledge gained by reading various PEPs like 1, 2 and 3.	Being able to effectively package and distribute the software is essential for the success of a any software project. This problem is often hard for non-trivial packages with severals dependencies. Python has a popular tool called pip to install packages from the Python Packaging Index (PyPI), but it doesn't always work, especially if the package has a non python dependencies like libblas and libxml. This is especially relevant for scientific and anlytics packages like scipy, numpy and theano where most of the heavy lifting is done by C or Fortran backends.Conda is a open source cross-platform package manager which effectively solves the python packaging problem. It was initially created for the needs of python scientific community, but it is python agnostic and can be used for other languages and tools too.

Cyber Intelligence using Python		Python can be used tp automate exploits, security checks, web analysis, forensic investigation and a lot more. No doubt, it is a profound language for a Hacker. We start any of our hack attack with finding information from publicly available sources which can range from website's whois to a complex Facebook graph search. In a generic terminology, this is known as Open Source Intelligence (OSINT). OSINT has its use cases, not only in hacking, but also in Business Intelligence, Corporate Espionage, Forensic Investigations and more.  By finding such information, an attacker can streamline his attack in order to make it more precise, effective and less noisy. As there lies a huge number of sources and variations of such useful information, this relatively becomes quite a hectic task to collect and co-relate this data. Hence there is a great need to automate this painful task ,we, (many of the hackers), have chosen Python.During the presentation, we will discuss and demonstrate about how we automated the process of OSINT and used the same in our security assessments. Below are some of the techniques which we will be talking about in our presentation:1. Useful social APIs (Facebook, Google CSE, Twitter APIs), Shodan, etc.2. Internet Wide scans for promoting Threat Intelligence.3. Integrating Python with readily available Frameworks like Maltego, Metasploit, etc.4. Custom Python tools, eg. user2sid and sid2user, Auth_check, testing utilities for checking vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, SSRF.5. Using python to do bug bounty by automating tasks.After the presentation, we will release these codes in open source channels.

Distributed scheduling leveraging multiple nodes in the cluster	http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Features/Scheduling_of_Snapshot	Setting up a cron job in a machine, is perhaps the most easiest way of scheduling a particular task. But in a distributed system, spawning across several nodes, critical tasks can't just be scheduled on a single node. That would introduce a single point of failure (SPOF). We also can't schedule the same set of jobs in every node, as we don't want duplication of a task. The solution to the above problem is a distributed cron scheduler spread across the cluster, working concurrently on different nodes to perform a task from a set of jobs in such a manner that we neither miss a job nor do we perform the same job twice.

Documentation: It's Important and Difficult		"One of the ways that we encourage non-coders to contribute to Open Source projects is by writing documentation. And sometimes, as developers, we tend to  look down on writing documentation. Personally, I think it's one of the most critical part of a project. If the documentation is hard to sort through or hard to read, there's going to be a whole bunch of frustrated users and contributors.How can you write good documentation? Last July, I attended an unconference called ""Write the Docs"" in Berlin and we had an open discussion about how to create an environment for building good documentation. In this talk, I'm hoping to present some of the rules that we came up with during those conversations and also talk about what we did in the CKAN project to make our documentation far better than it used to be.Summary of Rules"	Interest in documentation.

During the talk author will show a demo of processing a public data set ( wikipedia logs) of about 300 GB and get insights of the data ( say top 20 pages accessed in Wikipedia English  over one month)  with less than 30 lines of simple python code and by using amazon EMR ( Elastic Map Reduce ) which is a service provided by Amazon which takes care of provisioning of the computing power and also installation and configuration of Hadoop Map Reduce Cluster. Based on Author experience one of the main bottleneck in learning Big Data is complex nature of configuring the Hadoop Cluster for beginners. Instead of focussing on mundane activities of configuring infrastructure , one can leverage the existing economically feasible cloud infrastructure and focus their time on exploring the data.	Author will create the blog with detailed steps on how to setup the environment and start learning Big Data using Python and Cloud.

Exploring MicroServices for Cloud with Apache Thrift and Python		Many web applications start off as a monolithic code base, then move to a more distributed system. Large reports could take several minutes (and, sometimes, hours!) to complete, and users would become impatient waiting for their browser to finally display the result or the website would have already crossed limitations of how many requests it can handle. Service Oriented Architecture or MicroServices present a cleaner alternative to make system more distributed and adapt to current needs of the cloud. Not only does this improve scalability & resiliency, but it makes services independent entities operating on their own - which essentially means freedom of language & deployment. However in this model - the contract (also called as interface) between services is well understood and maintained.Apache Thrift, an open sourced framework demo Facebook, helps you in defining an Interface Definition Language file that help you:Strict contract across servicesEasy proof of concept with stubsFreedom to still implement your own business logic Minimise design level confusionsDuring the talk we would talk aboutIssues with monolithic web architectureSOA and MicroservicesApache thriftExample implementation with use caseDiscuss about performance		Vishal Kanaujia is a Python developer and technology enthusiast.

Geo-Python! Python for spatial data	GitHub repoSlides etc. will be uploaded shortly.If you wish more contents to be delved into, drop a comment.	Geoprocessing tasks can be time intensive since they are often performed on a number of different datasets or on large datasets with numerous records. Scripting is an efficient method of automating geoprocessing tasks. Example:Carry out multiple steps for a geospatial analysis and you have to then repeat these (e.g multiple years or multiple locations).With advent of satellite technology, aerial photography and imaging from UAV's, spatial data (data with is geo-located) has come off prominence. Google Maps and Open Street Maps are the most common real-life examples of how satellite imagery overlaid with physical layers (such as roads, point of interest etc.) can be used for varied applications - from navigation to resource allocation.This workshop is designed to give you the necessary building blocks / modules in python, which can be integrated and used for various purposes involving spatial data. The workshop is heavily derived from Geoprocessing with Python (by Chris Garrard) and will deal with the nuances of handling geo-referenced raster and vector data. Examples from Python for Hydrology will be touched upon and to show how Python has enabled the user community to use integrate statistics with time series satellite observations (if time permits) Participants will be exposed to following packages:If you are still not convinced, attend this - Simply to create python tools for the multi-billion dollar geoprocessing software industry!

Credential theft via use of Phishing Pages form a bulk of common-man-incidents in todays Information Security landscape. This talk is aimed at looking at ways to detect Phishing pages by leveraging large quantities of previously seen phishing pages and using machine learning algorithms to predict future phishing pages with a high degree of accuracy.Current systems to detect maliciousness of web pages rely on other factors such as the reputation of the domain name, the flux of the domain name, reputation of the IP address, whitelists and blacklistsWhile the above approaches have proved successful in the past, The content of the web page is the deciding factor to determine if a page is a phishing page or the original page for the activity. The model being designed has proved accurate to 99.97% with just over 10 features. Hence delivering promising results.	Willingness to ask questions.

  policies that are defined outside the application.Users may be expected or required to use a single sign-on
  technology such as Kerberos or SAML to authenticate to
  applications.This talk will familiarise the audience with these technologies and
demonstrate how Django applications can be integrated with an

Introduction to PySpark: Using Apache Spark with Python	IPython notebooks and slides will be uploaded soon.	Large scale and distributed data processing, for the most part, has not been fully available to Pythonistas (for a number of reasons). Therefore, while the Python ecosystem boasts of some of the best and most sophisticated data analysis libraries, it has not been able to fully harness parallelism and distributed computing for big data problems. This is not to say that big data problems are unsolvable within Python. They certainly are, and quite a few libraries have made decent attempts at doing so. But these solutions rarely come with the ease of development that makes Python so awesome. By all indications, PySpark changes that.PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark (http://spark.apache.org), a general purpose cluster computing framework. This tutorial is a hands-on tour of PySpark. In this tutorial, participants will be able to solve large scale data processing problems armed with only a little more than Python primitives.The tutorial will cover:	Knowledge prerequisitesSoftware Prerequisites(Something like Enthought Canopy or Anaconda will be ideal.)Note: Pandas and scikit-learn are required only to highlight some features of Spark by comparison. The tutorial will contain of a couple of examples from each of these libraries, and demonstrate how the same tasks can be performed with Spark.Software Setup: Some additional setup is required to configure Spark for flexible usage with the standard Python installations. I will soon upload notes detailing this setup process.	I'm a data scientist at DataCulture Analytics (http://dataculture.io) where I build large scale machine learning applications.

Learn Django, Redis and Celery by visualizing Twitter data.	https://github.com/harisibrahimkv/dj_workshop	Short version:The tutorial will cover writing a Django web project from step 0. The idea is to allow a full hands on experience developing a website. However, the experience has to be gratifying and something that can be built upon. Hence, over the process, we will cover fetching tweets from Twitter using the Twython framework, how to spawn off asynchornous celery tasks to handle the archival and visualizing the tweets per hour graph using Chart.js.Redis will be introduced to cover 3 simple use cases. Implementing a leaderboard, implementing a counter and implementing cache. These are 2 to 5 lines of code which makes a huge difference and impact on your web application. Redis will also be used as the task queue for celery.During the course of development, we will cover using models, forms, implementing views, how the ORM works, routing, templates, and how all these tie together during the flow of development. Long version:	Make an account on dev.twitter.com and register an app. Get the Consumer Key and Secret. After that, generate the Oauth token and secret. Keep these handy before coming to the workshop.I will have an offline version ready (tweet jsons in a txt file) just in case. You need to have the following softwares installed:Have a virtualenv (http://virtualenv.readthedocs.or...) up and running with the following packages installed.Any Linux distro (preferable Ubuntu).

Lessons from Open-Tamil Library for Indian Language Applications		"The first 20 years of Indian languages on the Internet have been  spent debating encoding schemes and editors, to be concerned with application development. India with its rich enthno-linguistic history needs to preserve and grow this heritage in the digital space. We believe this can be done only through writing novel, and useful applications specific to each languages.Proposed Content of the TalkOne such effort is the open-tamil library, designed to create high-level applications in Tamil. Open-Tamil library is a freely available package for Python 2 ( and Python 3K) to process Tamil text, and then some. We believe these lessons learnt from Open-Tamil can be reused for other Indian Languages on the web.Users may manipulate Tamil text at the letter level instead of worrying about encodings and code-points, leading to better separation of design and detailAPI allows for streaming algorithms on canonical Tamil data, independent of encodings. We show data analysis using Tamil wikipedia, and illustrate various computational linguistics applications. spell-checker APIOpen-Tamil has the distinction of being available for Python 2, and 3. It is continuously tested, and released via the Python package index.As a community developed effort, and due to proximity of the various Indian languages, we believe Open-Tamil can form a prototype open-source toolbox for other Indian languages.We have built a framework, and we can extend it to other Indian languagesRef: ""Open Tamil Text Processing Tools,"" M.

It brings out the main sections and what will be covered under each of the sections.http://www.slideshare.net/arthiv1/pycon2015-scopeDetailed slides of the contents uploaded in Slide Share.
http://www.slideshare.net/arthiv1/building-largescalepredictionsystemv1"	"This presentation is about how to build a scalable prediction system for near real time use using Python. A user will enter his / her requirements using Natural language.  The system will do a natural language processing of the input text.  Machine learning models will be used to predict the needed fields. This solution can be used for different use cases including agent allocations for Incident work bench ,  Recommendation services , etc. This presentation is based on our experience in creating and deploying  a large scale prediction system which is being used live across all employees of our company. 
Presentation will bring out
1.  Challenges in text classification
2.  Steps needed in text classification
3.  Why Python is suitable for this task and How we can solve some of the challenges using Python
4.  How to build a working text classifier in PythonSystem is built using combination of Natural Language Processing techniques and machine learning techniques with Python as the predominant 
language.
Takeaways from the talk will include what to look for in text classification and how to build an actual text classifier in Python.About Prediction Systems
Across different systems there is a need for users to select different options. Users need to select one from many possibilities. For example if you have a complaint you would need to select under which category this complaint has to be raised.  ( Department , sub group, specific class, etc ). Larger the number of possibilities more effort is needed from the end user to be able to narrow down on the correct selection. In many cases there is a hierarchical tree which has to be navigated for the user to be able to reach the correct selection.  If a top level selection is wrong user will never be shown the correct option which he  / she can choose.  Classification systems attempt to correctly assign to correct option for a given request.  If it is hierarchical selection the system should be able to predict across all levels.Machine Learning in Python. 
The heart of the prediction systems are the machine learning algorithms. Python has strong support for machine learning algorithms. The key package we will use is the scikit-learn package. This package is powerful and enables developers with minimal machine learning experience to develop powerful classification systems. Takeaways from the talk will include what to look for in text classification and how to build a  text classifier in Python."	While attempt would be made to make the presentation understandable to all, a Knowledge of Python  and Understanding of Machine Learning concepts and stages in machine learning would help the audience better appreciate the presentation.

Make your own Packet Sniffer	GitHub	A Sniffer is a computer program or a piece of computer hardware that can intercept and log traffic passing over a digital network or part of a network. As data streams flow across the network, the sniffer captures each packet and, if needed, decodes the packet's raw data showing the values of various fields in the packet, and analyzes its content according to the appropriate RFC or other specifications.  It is also sometimes known as a network analyzer/protocol analyzer/packet analyzer, or for particular types of networks, an Ethernet sniffer or wireless sniffer.This workshop would be dedicated to understanding socket programming in python to create a packet sniffer which can sniff all the incoming and outgoing packets from a particular interface (Ethernet or Wireless) without using any external libraries like libpcap. It will also sniff  all Ethernet frames , which means all kinds of IP packets(TCP , UDP , ICMP) and even other kinds of packets(like ARP).I will give a basic overview of python sockets, IP Headers, struct packing and unpacking for half an hour and then we will move to making our capstone project taking one step at a time.

Managing distributed file system with consistent distributed store & leader based algorithm	http://www.slideshare.net/AtinMukherjee/consensus-algo-withdistributedkeyvaluestoreindistributedsystem	In a typical distributed system managing n number of nodes in an effective way is always a challenge. Distributed systems always demands to meet CAP theorem which is really hard to meet with a good performance numbers. All the nodes participating in the cluster should have the consistent data which is one of the criteria of the CAP theorem. This could be achieved by keeping the configuration details across all the nodes in the cluster, however this algorithm doesn’t scale (considering n X n number of exchange of information) and can end up having split brain situations. This could be avoided having distributed consistent store across m number of nodes (considered) as leaders where m < n. There are few technologies like consul/etcd by which this can be achieved.	People should be aware of what a distributed system means and its good to have background on it.	Atin is a Glusterfs hacker and currently working as a Senior S/W Engineer in Redhat India.

Python bindings to a distributed filesystem	Good to know:	GlusterFS is a distributed file system capable of scaling to several petabytes (actually, 72 brontobytes!) and handling thousands of clients simultaneously. It lets you build a scalable networked storage using pretty much any common hardware. It is easy to start small and add more storage later. GlusterFS combines blocks of storage over the network into a single, large storage pool that is served to client appliances. Gluster can deliver exceptional performance for diverse workloads. It is free and open source software enabling people like you to build data storage with high performance and great value, for a variety of demanding applications. In this talk, we aim to cover two major topics:libgfapi-python (Python bindings to GlusterFS): Python applications can now easily access petabytes of storage space present in your cluster. It's as easy as this:You can now perform I/O on the storage volume just as you'd do using Python's os module. For example:glupy (Write translators using Python):Translators are stackable modules that can intercept and/or transform filesystem I/O operations. glupy module will allow translator code to be written in Python. It's based on the standard Python embedding (not extending) techniques, plus a dash of the ctypes module. This talk will outline how one could leverage glupy to write custom translators.While the python bindings allow the consumers to mount and use the filesystem, glupy will allow you to implement new features in GlusterFS internally.

Good to hear your viewpoint. I think, it is a pythonic talk because:

It has a very modular design. Even the default web UI is a separate python module. Installed using shinken installer (shinken install webui).
Plugins can be written in any language, including python. I have some of mine in a github repo.

Real-time processing of high-velocity social media data streams with Apache Storm	I don't have slides currently but would put them up ASAP.	"For real-time analytics, processing data faster than the consumption process is imperative. With social media, even more so. There are a lot of options re: task and messaging queues, for e.g. celery, RabbitMQ etc. Both are broker-centric and maintain a state of every event which happens and this leaves an extra dependency layer. Storm, however, works completely within it's own layer when it comes to consumption and processing of tasks. This immediately makes it more lightweight and easier to maintain.   Storm is an open-source distributed ""real-time"" computing system. It processes as it receives and is often looked at as the real-time counterpart to Hadoop's batch-processing prowess. It is based on a ""topology"" architecture divided into two computing units: Spouts and Bolts. Spouts generate the data and feed it to Bolts which process it and may/may not feed it to further bolts. Storm is scalable, guarantees the processing of any data that has been generated, simple to setup and can be used with any language. USP: Twitter owns this project now and uses it for their analytics."	There isn't much in terms of pre-requisites, but awareness of how social-media works would be great. Knowledge about Twitter/Facebook APIs would be an added bonus.	I am Sarthak, backend engineer with Airwoot. I've been working full-time with Python over the last 2 and a half years and have always had an inclination towards data-science and making sense of open data.

I'm extremely active on Twitter and during big events, often open up my Python console and take quick digs at checking out how they're spreading. At Airwoot, we work with social-data on a daily basis and feedback from our clients has led us to believe analytics is one of our stronger suits. Our tech stack is completely Python with databases spread across PostgreSQL and MongoDB. We have been using Apache Storm for our analytics over the last few months and have derived fantastic value off it.

Reasoning under uncertainty with Python	Pylearn repository on GitHub |  Speakerdeck slides |   Youtube lectures | Value From Data Initiative 	"Uncertainty is a fundamental - and unavoidable -  feature of daily life.  In order to deal with uncertainty intelligently, we need to be able to represent it and reason about it. - Joseph HalpernThe problem of reasoning rationally in the face of uncertain knowledge presents itself in domains as diverse as engineering, medicine, ecology, and business. The pragmatic solution to this problem is to combine Boolean logic (which is the mathematics of certain propositions) with Bayesian probability (which is the mathematics of uncertainty). This combination provides us with a powerful semantic framework that allows us to Given this tremendous expressive power, it is not surprising that many of today's cutting-edge machine learning, artificial intelligence and data science, algorithms are based on a combination of logic and probability. The emerging field of probabilistic programming attempts to provide a coherent computational framework for reasoning under uncertainty. In this workshop, we want to introduce these ideas to the Python programming community. The aim of the workshop is to provide a short theoretical introduction to reasoning under uncertainty  followed by a long hands-on session where the theory is fleshed out by analyzing real life situations, casting them as problems of reasoning under uncertainty, and solving the problems using Python tools.The workshop will prepare participants to take on challenges in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science. We want to use standard tools in the Python data and visualization toolchain to accomplish the aim above. Instead of using a monolithic toolkit, we want to combine the building blocks provided by the excellent Python modules mentioned below to show the participant how they can create their own cutting-edge reasoning, inference, and learning algorithms. It is recommended that all participants have the Anaconda distribution pre-installed on their laptops. The theoretical introduction will cover The hands-on will coverThe real life applications we want to present  areNOTE : the examples above can be revised depending on feedback. At the end of the workshop, participants will be able to analyze a problem in their domain to decide if it can be treated as a problem of reasoning under uncertainty - surprisingly many problems can! They will be able to formulate their problem in standard Python tools (Scipy, Pandas, NetworkX) and arrive at answers to questions of inference, learning and decision making. They will be able to present these answers in an appealing visual form, ready for 
dissemination on the web.  "	Participants must know Python and be familiar with the Ipython notebook interface. Knowledge of Scipy, Pandas, and NetworkX will be an advantage.

Scripting Metasploit with Python		"For little more flexibility in Metasploit, to lay the groundwork for how you can get Metasploit's MSGPACK Remote Procedure Call (RPC) interface and the Python programming language to play nicely together while at the same time demonstrating how it could be used in practice. Let's lay out the testing scenario. Assume, through one method or another, I've obtained the clear-text password for a single user - Bob. I have Bob's Windows credentials and can easily, through RDP or psexec, access his machine. I've determined that Bob is a Linux Administrator. I wish to determine what, if any, Linux servers allow me to log in as ""root"" using Bob's compromised password.For this exercise, I'll be interacting with Metasploit via the RPC interface (rather than directly with the console). The RPC interface allows clients to locally or remotely execute Metasploit commands, including running aux modules and exploits, interacting with sessions, talking to a database, etc. Python, a popular scripting language, can communicate over RPC. Therefore, I can write a Python script to ""remote control"" my Metasploit instance.At the end, you can interact with the established sessions through the open msfconsole or create additional scriptable events executed through the Python script. Of course, my entire example that i would demonstrate would be a bit contrived, considering the same could be accomplished simply through msfconsole and by setting the RHOSTS option to the 10.0.1.1/24. Again, this is intended to be a basic introduction of Metasploit's RPC interface and its usage in Python."	Little Knowledge About Linux/Shell/Python.	"i <3 OPEN SOURCE.

Securing Applications via Federated Identities (SAML, OAuth 2.0, OpenID)	Prezi Presentation Prezi PDF 	Single sign-on (SSO) started it all. Organizations needed a way to unify authentication systems in the enterprise for easier management and better security. Single sign-on was widely adopted and provided a solution for keeping one repository of usernames and passwords that could be used transparently across several internal applications.  The problem? How to bring together user login information across many applications and platforms to simplify sign-on and increase security. The solution? Federated identities . What is federated identity ?Federated identity means linking and using the electronic identities a user has across several identity management systems. In simpler terms, an application does not necessarily need to obtain and store users’ credentials in order to authenticate them. Instead, the application can use an identity management system that is already storing a user’s electronic identity to authenticate the user—given, of course, that the application trusts that identity management system.

https://speakerdeck.com/poojasalpekar/test-drive-ansible-infrastructure"	“When deploying and administering large infrastructures, it is still common to think in terms of individual machines rather than view an entire infrastructure as a combined whole. This standard practice creates many problems, including labor-intensive administration, high cost of ownership, and limited generally-available knowledge or code usable for administering large infrastructures.”— Steve Traugott and Joel HuddlestonServer infrastructure has traditionally lagged far behind our development practices in terms of code quality, testing, continuous integration and continuous development.When you write your Ansible scripts or any other CM, you are coding, and every code is prone to defects. All of us understand the benefits of test-driving the application code. The same applies to your infrastructure code. Testing becomes even more significant in case of deployments spanning large clusters of nodes.Test-driving allows the infrastructure teams to have confidence that their configuration changes are being applied as intended across many different systems, and having the intended effect. This allows the whole system to be trusted, and then updated without fear for introducing breaking changes or otherwise causing instability.The objective is to cover agile lifecycle of infrastructure code and provide a quick demo of how to test drive Ansible scripts.

Test your code the python way		"If you don't test your test your code, you shall be introducing bugs in production. Even today, there are myths about testing that every QA requires to fight. If writing code for an application(development) is an art, so is writing test cases for the application. What approach a person should take while he begins to test a given application. Can you escape manual testing if you aim at 100% automation?
unittest by the name implies ""unit testing"", can you use the framework for any other type of testing other than unit testing. How about Py.test? Is this something which is new and efficient or people still prefer unittest today. How about implementing Behaviour Driven Tests to make your tests more readable and understandable to people.

Testing distributed & clustered Filesystem (Block & object based) using rpyc and other tools.	https://github.com/Amit05/glusterfs-automation-framework	Clustered or distributed Filesystems, Volume managers and other related storage softwares are not only complex to develop but are equally challenging to test. Communicating across various nodes, accessing & exploiting caches and locks across the nodes and connecting to various ports are some of the challenges every tester faces. Additionally, the resilience of these systems is another hurdle as it requires maintaining the state of test process.Unless a robust test harness is developed, testing these products always ends in many gaps left unplugged in the code. Thankfully, we have Python.

Thinking in Functions	Final SlidesSlides for the proposed workshop : Thinking in Functions (on progress)Slides for a few sessions the speaker has presented:Faster Python @ PyConAmbidextrous Python @ DevConPrototyping Painkiller StartupsGetting Started with git @ FOSSMeet, NITCFuture of Computing	Use some of the Functional Programming concepts applicable to Python, to write concurrent and scalable Python code.Python is NOT meant to be a functional programming language[1]. At the same time, writing functional programs has been the most efficient way to build scalable systems (Eg: WatsApp, RabbitMQ). This puts the developer in a hard position to choose from. There has been enough systems in the ecosystem to enable users to make user of functional programming in Python. But, there are very limited resources for programmers to select what matters them most and make use of functional concepts within python language. Many of the functional programming aspects like tail recursion and currying are not directly available in python, and the workshop doesn't intend to make python a complete functional programming language [2]. At the same time, making use of many functional concepts while writing Python code will enable it to be run parallel and some concurrently in turn making it more scalable.Attendees will be working on a live project to learn how to think each functionality as functions, and separate data objects to make sure of the separation of concerns and how to minimize side effects. Workshop will discuss on modularizing programs and principles of separation of concerns. It will also touch up on map-reduce and  minimizing side effects.

Use DevOps to bootstrap your startup infra and sleep peacefully at night	I will update the content later. Right now I don't have anything ready.	Startups in initial phases are fast. But once they start getting customers there comes a point when they need to scale up their infra. Thats when then realize the scaling the infra in its current state is damn difficult. Most of them wish only if somebody told them about how to build a robust and scalable infra. With lots of business priorities they cant manage to spend time researching on these things. Hiring experienced devops person is hard as the startup might very well be bootstrapped on funds. Issues like webserver process suddenly stopping and disk getting filled adds to more and more frustration. After ignoring or postponing these issues, usually they become pretty frequent. This might distract the devs and considerably slow down the product releases or worst, disappoint the customers and end up losing business built with so much hard work.Through this talk I would like startup newbies what commons problems they might come across. Guide them to leverage Python and Linux(to some extent) to fix infra issues, make releases faster and peacefully sleep at night(hopefully).Session will cover high level overview of common issues and strategies likeThere wont be any deep diving into tools but this will be more of a infra strategy talk.

Writing Mercurial Hooks For Fun and Profit!	https://mercurial.selenic.com/	Mercurial is one of the leading SCM tools and any good SCM tool worth its salt has hooks that can be set up to do things like pre-commit verifications, run tests etc. Mercurial is written Python. Hg hooks can be written in Python.Writing good commit messages is as important for a project as writing good code and one needs practice to write good commit messages (like anything else in life) and often developers do not take this bit very seriously and hence sometimes strict rules and policies need to be implemented. Using commit hooks, a project can enforce policies. This talk will try to solve this problem.In this talk, I will cover the basics of what commit hooks are, fundamental concepts of Mercurial hooks, various terminologies relevant to Mercurial hooks and how Hg commit hooks are written. I will start from scratch and develop a simple but very useful Mercurial hook in Python that will do bunch of pre-commit validations. The hook I plan to showcase during the talk will be very close to a real life commit hook that I have used in production.Talk Outline :Key takeaways from the talk would be the following :Anyone with basic knowledge of Python and some experience with any modern SCM tool can attend this talk.

Demystifying the Django REST Framework		This will be an intermediate tutorial on Django REST Framework. For a first time user, DRF presents a ton of magic. Things work, but you end up not knowing or understanding what is happening behind the scenes. If you would want to tweak something, you wouldn't know where to start or what to look at.I've had quite a few frustrating moments trying to figure out what method mapped to which action, and which ones to override when. The fact that DRF does not impose the REST architecture confused me to a good extent as well. Nested relationships was another beast which was hard to tame.This tutorial will build an app - not a full fledged front end design but the endpoints that are required, and will showcase implementing endpoints using complete abstraction that DRF provides including Routers, ViewSets and builtin Serializers as the first step.The second step will break the ViewSets and implement them as normal class based views, showing what happens behind the scenes. How the method are mapped, how it flows through from the moment a request hits one of the views.The third step will involve writing the routers by hand, using normal views and how to fine tune serializers to add your custom fields, etc.	Participants should have prior experience using Django. Having completed the official tutorial on the Django website should be good enough.	Former Geek herder @HasGeek. Used to be Python tamer @Eventifier and now @aksharadotorg. An amateur writer.

A partial differential equation solver using Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib		This talk will detail how Python (and its libraries) can be used to write a compact solver for a partial differential equation (PDE) solver which describes the evolution of a physical system. Numpy's vector operations and Matplotlib's advanced plotting capabilities can be used to solve the equation and then vary physical parameters.A PDE is a differential equation which contains functions of several variables. Thus the derivatives involved are partial derivatives. PDEs are a crucial part of physics as they accurately model the behaviour of real systems. Their solution occupies a large amount of the time consumed on large scale high performance computers for tasks such as computational fluid dynamics, computational mechanics and computational electromagnetics which are used for modelling systems as diverse in size scale and complexity as climate and environmental modelling, the Universe, cars, planes, trains, ships and optical devices.In our school curricula, we learn analytic solutions to basic differential equations. However, most equations of interest cannot be solved analytically and must be solved numerically. Here is where the features of the language used to write the solver becomes important. Python has some amazing features which makes it suitable for use in such cases.We will be looking at the following points in the talkThis talk will be oriented in highlighting Python's features for obtaining easy and intuitive solutions to PDEs. While the background is a bit mathematical, I will try to sidestep it and make life simpler.	These are not strict prerequisites and anybody and everybody is welcome.	I am a PhD student in the Dept. of Electrical Engineering, IIT Madras. I have been studying the evolution of nanomagnetic systems and have been using Python extensively for my research.		"[{u'text': u'I am assuming (since it is not evident from the proposal) that you would like to demonstrate how to design a solver for a partial differential equation.

API Security Assessment (ASA) - Securing Pesky API's with Python	TBD	All API end points have a complex way of handling security principles such as Identity, Authorization and managing data. While there are some really good Web Application security products out there that do a great job of securing web applications in general. However Securing and auditing API's is more than a challenge for these products to handle. Developing an automated tool based on python that takes care of securing the API's is the need of the hour. Automated API Security Assessment tool developed in Python takes the pain out of testing API's for security vulnerabilities. The tool covers the following:Detailed Description Of Functionality Of the ToolThe tools used several native and third party libraries and scripts to do an automated API security assessment.

Add intelligence to your Python apps using cognitive services		To get their apps to the ‘next’ level, a lot of developers explore the ways to add machine-based Artificial Intelligence to applications – more so, with the spurt in IoT applications and bots today. This can be challenging for a developer who has never ventured into ML and AI before. In this session, we will try to break that barrier – by using Cognitive Services in Python apps. These are a host of intelligent services which you can directly consume in your applications – such as, detecting emotions based on facial expressions, detecting and recognizing human faces in images, speaker recognition, computer vision, etc. In this talk, we will explore on how to integrate such services into Python applications, supported by live demos.Draft version of slides: https://1drv.ms/p/s!AtvI8sW8wXiDheVxsHas2zz1zM0sFg 	Basic knowledge of PythonInterest in AI	 Saurabh Kirtani – Technology Evangelist, Microsoft As a Technology Evangelist, Saurabh Kirtani enjoys getting developers on-board with various technologies.

Algorithmic Music Generation	https://github.com/unnati-xyz/music-generation	Music is mainly an artistic act of inspired creation and is unlike some of the traditional math problem.  Music cannot be solved by a simple set of formulae. The most interesting and challenging part is producing unique music without infringing the copyright. The generated music has to sound good, and what sounds good is very subjective. The model is mainly built for producing Indian music.Artificial Neural Network/Deep Learning has wide range of application, such as in Image processing, Natural language processing, Time series prediction, etc. But what about its usage in art? This talk shows how deep learning was used to generate music.Deep learning attempts to model high-level abstractions in data by using multiple processing layers whereas the traditional Machine learning algorithms emphasizes on what work the computer program must do after it is given a data set. The basic idea in deep learning is  to perform an unsupervised learning procedure on every single layer in addition to using gradient descent for the network as a whole. The goal of the unsupervised learning is to make each single layer extract characteristic features out of its input that can be used by subsequent layers. The neural network architecture makes use of numerous amount of Indian music to train the model. After adequate number of iterations and training time, this model generates music that is unique and  original.This talk will also cover some of the challenges and trade-offs made for algorithmic music generation.

An example-driven guide to writing effortless, fast tests with pytest for your Django project.	Work in progress. Will update this section with the slides soon. Please let me know if this need to be expedited. 	We all know we should be writing tests, yet most of us don’t. Many Django developers I know want to get started, but don’t have a clue on how to. Some, on the other hand, write weak tests that take a long time to run which leads to testing not well and often enough. Django has awesome support for testing, though the docs don’t explain how to go about it. Atleast not well enough. There are a few good ideas and best practices to easily write fast tests for your new/existing Django projects.This will be a beginner-intermediate level talk. I won’t talk much about what testing is and why it’s important, because we all know that. I will also not make Pytest the center of this talk, rather we’ll focus more on Django, tips on writing testable code, other best-practices and how some testing tools could make your life, as a developer, a wee bit easier. I’ll be going over the following topics Why you should write tests.Sneaking tests into your code.Structuring tests.What makes your tests slow and how to improve.How tests force you to write clean, maintainable code in DjangoWhy use Pytest.When and what to mock.Why JSON fixtures are a bad idea, and what the alternative is.Brief explanation of other testing tools and methodologies in the Django world.If you work with Django, and don’t write many (or any) tests because you’re short on time, you work with legacy codebase, you lack enough knowledge, or because testing appears to be overwhelming, then you may find this talk interesting.	Basic experience working with Django.	I’m work as the CTO at Entri, an EduTech startup based in Kerala. Previously, I was leading the engineering team of a software services company. I conduct a lot of workshops on Python and Django and I am a coach at DjangoGirls workshops in Kochi.

An update on SymEngine, a fast symbolic manipulation library	Contents of presentation prepared by the SymEngine team lies here https://github.com/certik/scipy-2016-symengine-talk/	"The goal of SymEngine is to be the
fastest C++ symbolic manipulation library (opensource or commercial),
compatible with SymPy, that can be used from many languages (Python, Ruby,
Julia, ...). We will present the current status of development, how things are
implemented internally, why we chose C++, benchmarks, and examples of usage
from Python (SymPy and Sage), Ruby and Julia.SymPy is a widely used symbolic manipulation library in Python. While SymPy
turns out to be very useful for many applications, one of the long term
problems with SymPy is that the speed might be insufficient when handling of
very large expressions is required. Another problem with SymPy is that due to
being written in Python, it can be cumbersome to use from other languages like
Julia, Ruby, JavaScript or C++, because it requires, say, a Python to Julia
bridge, which might not always be robust and which inflicts additional
overhead.For these reasons, we implemented SymEngine, an open source C++ symbolic
manipulation library, with the goal of being the fastest library for symbolic
manipulation (opensource or commercial), and allowing natural wrappers to other
languages like Python (the most mature wrapper), Ruby, Julia and others.We will show benchmarks against other computer algebra systems (opensource and
commercial) as well as examples of usage from Python (SymPy and Sage), Ruby and
Julia. We will present a roadmap how to port SymPy on top of SymEngine.We will talk about why we chose C++ and what rules to follow so that the code
cannot have an undefined behavior in Debug mode (thus providing similar ease of
development as one is used to from Python).The SymEngine C++ library already has 36 contributors, 109 forks and 146 stars
on GitHub, as of June 30, 2016.SymEngine should fix the slowness of SymPy, while providing a familiar
interface, and at the same allowing many languages to naturaly use it, thus
creating a common platform/tool that many projects (like SymPy, Sage, ...) can
use as their main symbolic engine and all contribute back to it."	Nothing as such, basic math to appreciate examples preferred.	"Sumith is currently a third year computer science undergraduate student at IIT Bombay.

Asynchronous Programming with Python	What to expect in the talk is briefly described in the presentation here : http://slides.com/priyankt68/asynchronous-programming-in-python	"As a programmer, each one of us begin their programming with sequential execution of a program loop. But as we build more and more complex applications, there exists a need to do some input/output which should not block the execution of your program. For instance, a program is halted while it's waiting for user to provide input. Now, that's a problem and certainly not an efficient utilisation of one's computing resources. How do you solve it ? One maybe tempted to use threads or multiprocessing but it has it's own share of memory constraints.To your rescue comes, Asynchronous Programming.Asynchronous Programming or I/O 
is a form of input/output processing that permits other processing to continue before the transmission has finished.
More on it here.This talk will discuss more on the drawbacks of multiprocessing and thread and build a case for asynchronous programming. At the end of the talk, a demo will make things much clearer to the audience."	Participants are expected to have basic working knowledge of Python and socket programming.

Automating Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) using Python		"Open Source Intelligence is the art of collecting information which is scattered on publicly available sources. With evolution of social media and digital marketplaces a huge amount of information is constantly generated on the Internet (sometimes even without our conscious consent). This is of great concern for organisations and businesses as chances of confidential data floating in the public domain may seriously harm their business integrity. Similarly from a pentester's perspective it is important to collect as much information as possible about the target before going for the kill.Based on experience and robust research in this domain, for this talk the speakers have created a tool (https://github.com/upgoingstar/datasploit) which will help all kind of organisations to identify the threat landscape they expose, without much investment. This tool is simple but an effective solution which is capable of collecting information which is usually missed or ignored, but shouldn’t be.

During the presentation, we will discuss and demonstrate how we automated the process of OSINT and used the same in our security assessments. Topics covered will include:"		Sudhanshu Chauhan is an information security professional and OSINT specialist. He has worked in the information security industry, previously as Senior security analyst at iViZ and currently as Director and Principal Consultant at Octogence Technologies. Sudhanshu has also written various articles on a wide range of topics including Cyber Threats, Vulnerability Assessment, Honeypots, Metadata etc and Co-authored ‘Hacking Web Intelligence’.Shubham is an active Information Security researcher at NotSoSecure, with 4 years of experience in offensive and defensive security, with interests in Infrastructure security and OSINT. He has given training, conducted numerous workshops and delivered talks at local security chapters and multiple conferences, including Nullcon 2016, Null Delhi and Bangalore chapters, etc. In his free time, he loves to craft open source tools in python, and if the weather is nice, he loves to ride his bike.

Big Data Analysis using PySpark	I am planning for a Jupyter Notebook based presentation and the sample notebooks (which I have used for other PySpark talks) can be found here. The code to load StackExchange data as Spark Dataframes can be found here.	Apache Spark™ is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It runs programs up to 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce in memory, or 10x faster on disk and combines SQL, streaming, and complex analytics.PySpark is the Python binding for Apache Spark. In the talk, I would focus on what Spark is all about and the different ways it can be used with Python - scripts/shell/Jupyter. Then I would move on to how Spark (PySpark) can be leveraged for Big Data Analytics and how does it provide an improvement over other data processing engines like Apache Hadoop. For demo purpose, I would be using the publicly available StackOverflow Data to demonstrate how we can use PySpark to draw interesting insights from StackOverflow and its sister sites. For example, did you know that there is a high positive correlation between the reputation of a user and number of upvotes he has cast?	Attendees should be comfortable with Python.	I am a developer working with the Analytics team at Adobe Systems. I have been actively using Spark for the past 1 year and Python for past 4 years. I am helping as a teaching assistant for the 3-course series titled Data Science and Engineering with Spark XSeries, created in partnership with professors from University of California, Berkeley, University of California, Los Angeles and Databricks and offered on the edX platform.

Building Interactive Search Interfaces (aka chat-bots) in Python using Django and TensorFlow	Link to the presentation: https://www.dropbox.com/s/1egi7ccwk1bu5de/chat-bots-pycon.pdf?dl=0	There has been growing interest on shedding boring and cumbersome “search and get thousand results” interface to move towards a “conversational” interface to ease the reception of deluge of information in various web and mobile applications. While a naive search bar that simplified information extraction and delivery of web pages was the rage in early 2000s, exponential increase in data and information on the Internet is making it natural for the search bar to evolve into a smarter and responsive interface. Not only can this search bar be more responsive in terms of guiding users in an iterative aka conversation based search, but it can also be assistive in fetching information that suits the interests of different users. Sooner or later, such conversational interface will replace the old-generation search bar.However, building such conversational interface has several technology challenges: a) the interface has to understand and extract intent from natural human inputs in terms of text or speech (this is partly done by the current generation search interfaces), b) it has to generate meaningful dialogue responses to engage users into a conversation, c) it has to understand and use context to assist users in fetching the most relevant information, and while doing so d) make the information results personalized to the user as she uses the interface over time.How do we solve these technology challenges? Is the ‘conversational search’ a hype or soon to be reality? How are recent advances in deep learning playing their role towards building such ‘chat bots’? How can we build a real interactive search interface using existing web (or Django) and machine learning frameworks. In this talk, I will take a deep dive to answer these questions and present the state of the art in building conversational agents during Django and Tensorflow (and Python, of course!). Tensorflow is a machine/deep learning package (using Python) open sourced by Google and has several advanced features to parse user text queries and personalize search results.Specifically, I will talk about building Django-based rest frameworks without and with websockets to enable interactive text search interfaces. Such interfaces are expected to become pervasive in coming years to replace web search bar, e-commerce search bars or any domain specific search engines such as education, healthcare etc. I will talk about implementation details of API using Django to enable such interface. The talk will also give an overview of the current state of deep learning techniques to build a chat bot, and provide details a few techniques such as LSTM or sequence to sequence learning in building a chat bot in reality.

Well, the answer to all these question is one-Recommendation Engines. From millions of products existing on a website, it is very difficult for a user to land on a product of his need as well as his choice. But with the inception of Artificial Intelligence, a few algorithms were introduced to perform this difficult task and with the progress in technology, these algorithms were refined as well as customized as per the user requirements by various organizations. In simplest way, Recommendation Engine learns about your behavior with different techniques and recommends you products that seems suitable for you according to the algorithm.In this talk I'll cover the following topics with code in Python:Recommendation EnginesTypes of recommendation Engines.Various frameworks used for the same purpose (Their comparison with python).Step wise guidance to make an engine- Data Acquisition, Data Cleaning, Implementing various models.Problems faced during developments of recommendation systems.Various libraries of Python used for the same purpose.Metrics used to measure the accuracy of a recommendation engine.Functions that can help to improve your engine for better results as the data gets bigger."

Building a scalable NBA Sports Analytics Platform using Python Data Stack	https://github.com/rouseguy/NBA_SportVu	Devising strategies when the game is on based on in-game analytics is hard. Sports like basketball and soccer are free-flowing. Not long ago, most analysts used some form of aggregated metrics as the performance indicators and decisions were based on them. Examples include total points scored in the game, total rebounds in the game, etc.  But finer nuances of the game like which players were impacting the offense and defense in what ways were difficult to measure. From 2013, STATS SportVU started providing player tracking data for every single NBA game. This led to a explosion of data, leading to a greater emphasis on analytics amongst all the 30 teams. Teams were able to construct rosters using analytics. What are some of the challenges in designing such a system?Python's data stack packs a punch when it comes to designing such a system. This talk covers how some of the above challenges were overcome using the Python data stack.  In particular, the talk will touch upon Blaze, Dask, Numba, Bokeh and Luigi.

Building a secure IoT platform using Paho and Flask		MQTT and COAP are very common light weight protocols for IoT development.  One area that developers overlook during initial development is making it secure from day 1. This session will focus on a couple of approaches to make the interaction between the device and data collection server more secure and reliable using  HTTPS based key exchange and signed MQTT packets.  Paho is a light weight and easy to use library that handles most of the pub/sub, marshall/unmarshall, data transformation tasks.  Second area that we focus is getting maximum data from the device that will help you with diagnostics in early stage of development.

Building an automatic keyphrase extraction system using NLTK in Python	https://github.com/P2Pvalue/teem-taghttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VLjU2MQnB3GUw7p4z_Q6olFdYoW2q-LTsE8OUFZqrgI/edit?usp=sharing	"Ever wondered how Google search shows relevant results first even though the query you searched belonged to the results on Page 2 also (in a nutshell how the famous Google Page Rank works) or how your post get's automatically categorised in Quora or how Medium groups articles into clusters based on the article's context? Extraction of important topical words and phrases from documents, commonly known as terminology extraction or automatic keyphrase extraction is a hot topic in the research field. It comes under one of the crucial tasks in natural language processing for purposes of automatically extracting structured information from unstructured (text) datasets.
Keyphrases provide a concise description of a document’s content; they are useful for document search, clustering, categorization, and summarization; help in building a content based recommendation system as you can quantify semantic similarity with other documents. 
Since we are producing raw data now more than ever, clustering and contextualizing data becomes a more difficult task. With the help of Python and specifically NLTK it becomes a tad bit easier. My talk will provide information regarding methodology, keyphrase selection (unsupervised and supervised methods), algorithms which help us quantify weights relative to document corpus followed by a step wise guidance on building a decent keyphrase extraction system using NLTK in Python.

The XML dialect called AIML was developed by Richard Wallace and a worldwide free software community between 1995 and 2002. AIML formed the basis for what was initially a highly extended Eliza called ""A.L.I.C.E.."" (""Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity""), which won the annual Loebner Prize Competition in Artificial Intelligence[3] three times, and was also the Chatterbox Challenge[4] Champion in 2004.(2) It would then go on to how to use standard and create a standard startup file, creating an AIMl file and generating random responses.(3) Then I would move on to integration of python, adding sessions and predicates in the XML file. I would then demo a very basic chatbot in python.(4) I would then introduce different packages which could be useful, nltk.chat, chatterbot.(5) I would then also show an example of using pywit (A python wrapper for wit.ai API) for building chatbots using python."

CollabFilter - A Python package for clustering items by similarity (Collaborative Filtering).	https://github.com/unnati-xyz/collaborative-filtering	"Ever wondered how Amazon recommends items quite accurately while you were busy looking at another item? Or about how Netflix recommends a movie to you that you have been wanting to watch for a long time now? This talk covers a kind of recommendation system known as Collaborative Filtering, which works by searching a large group of users and finding a smaller set with tastes similar to a particular user for whom the recommendation is made. It looks at the collection of items they have liked and combines them to create a ranked list of suggestions. Two flavours of this are item-based filtering and user-based filtering. The differences between these two can be expressed as-  
1. “Users who liked this item also liked...”- Item-based Collaborative Filtering                                                                                                                                    
2. “Users similar to you also liked...”- User-based Collaborative FilteringA comprehensive open-source package in Python for Collaborative Filtering does not exist.

Concurrency in modern Robots: Introducing the Robot Operating System.	Outline of talkFinal presentation will be based on thisIntro and tutorials of ROS: https://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/ros/ROS website:  http://www.ros.org/Talk content will be updated here : https://github.com/shivamvats/Pycon-ROS-Talk	Heard of the Google Self Driving car? Ever wondered how such autonomous systems work?If the answer is yes, then this talk is for you.Robots have arrived. From factories to space, robots are everywhere. The focus now, is on building inexpensive and intelligent robots that can think on their own. And as they grow more complex, robotic systems are becoming increasingly concurrent. With massive development efforts being undertaken all over the world in robotics, there is a need to have a common framework that allows code and hardware sharing and is scalable to allow numerous concurrent processes.Robot Operating System (ROS) is one such framework, that is the de facto standard for robotics software development across the world. It is successfully being used in industry, academia and personal projects to allow robots to talk to each other and work collectively. ROS is open source and language independent, with Python and C++ being its most popular implementations. It also provides tools and libraries for obtaining, building, writing, and running code across multiple computers. If you want to be part of the ongoing robotics revolution,  learning ROS will let you choose from the affordable TurtleBot, the capable and friendly Baxter , or even NASA’s Robonaut, currently undergoing testing on the International Space Station. With over 100 robots supporting ROS, you are spoilt for choice. The talk will introduce the inherent problem of concurrency in Robots, and how we can use ROS to mitigate some of those problemss:		Shivam is a 4th year undergraduate and robotics enthusiast at IIT Kharagpur.

Continuous Integration for Data Scientists	"A working draft of the slides can be found here: https://github.com/jaidevd/jaidevd.github.io/blob/source/blog/posts/continuous-integration-for-data-scientists.ipynb
I'm updating this almost everyday."	This talk is about debugging, scaling and ultimately deploying a prototype of a machine learning application to a production system.Broadly, the development and maintenance stages of a machine learning product can be broken down as follows:In a live project, these steps may not necessarily be separated in time, in that it may not be possible to do one after the other sequentially. Engineers normally need to keep rising, lathering and repeating these steps to get a workable product out. The point of this talk is that some of these stages are very repetitive and can be automated.In general, data-driven projects have a lot to benefit from the kind of work that normally devops and build engineers do. Specifically, I will be taking some examples and demonstrating in detail how CI tools can be invaluable in iterating through the development cycle of a machine learning project. Continuous integration, in this case, can be thought of as simply something that runs a predefined script regularly, or is triggered by an external event. Indeed, this is useful (and popular) in building and testing, but the flexibility of a CI system can be leveraged to accomplish arbitrary tasks.In part, this talk is also about culture and habits. I will be speaking in detail about what data scientists can learn from build and devops engineers - and how adopting even the most common CI practices can be extremely rewarding for a data scientist. I will try to justify the claim that data scientists need to spend as much time with Jenkins, as they do with IPython notebooks.		I'm a data scientist at Cube26 Software Pvt Ltd. I have previously worked and consulted on a number of data science projects and products. I build data-driven products and the tooling around them for a living.

Creating a recommendation engine based on NLP and contextual word embeddings	Code: https://github.com/manasRK/word2vec-recommenderThe code is messy, will be cleaning the code. Slides will be updated soon.	"How can we create a recommendation engine that is based both on user browsing history and product reviews? Can I create recommendations purely based on the 'intent' and 'context' of the search? How do I use natural language processing techniques to create valid recommendations?This talk will showcase how a recommendation engine can be built with user browser history and user-generated reviews using a state-of-the-art technique - word2vec. We will create something that not only matches the existing recommender systems deployed by websites, but goes one step ahead - incorporating context to generate valid and innovative recommendations. The beauty of such a framework is that not only does it support online learning, but is also sensitive to minor changes in user tone and behavior.The trick/secret sauce is - How do we account for the 'context' and build it in our systems? The talk will answer these questions and showcase effectiveness of such a recommender system.MOTIVATIONS & PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS:The current recommender systems tend to misfire when user history is not known or new products are introduced into the mix. Missing user ratings add more complexity and create hindrances to relevant recommendations. Also, the current websites, especially in the domain of  food or travel, don't allow me to do a contextual search, like ""best chicken tikkas in South Delhi"". The results depend on the keywords appearing in the title or description, but rarely in the reviews + user browsing history.We have built two models using word2vec, which are;META MODEL: 
Created with the user browsing history. This contains more than 9.4 million product histories. The attempt is to mimic and improve upon existing collaborative filtering systems.USER REVIEW MODEL:
Currently websites don’t allow us to search on “context”. This model intakes reviews and attempts to create a framework for a “contextual search engine”.This is our attempt to propose and demonstrate a framework that’s more rounded and preserves context while generating recommendations. The current architecture looks something like this;The top results have high affinity among each other, and occur in Amazon’s website itself in the “also bough/also viewed” section. The precison at 3 results (P@3) is 58% currently. Howevever, P@15 is at 100%. We are currently improving the system and working on pre-processing techniques."

XOR 


description


a few properties of XOR 
                   0 ⊕ 0=0        1 ⊕ 0=1
                   0 ⊕ 1=1        1 ⊕ 1=0



Bitwise XOR : python provide ^ operator to perform bitwise XOR on integers. It does this by first expressing those two integers in binary  , and then performing XOR on their respective bits. Hence the name, bitwise XOR.
                            73 ⊕ 87 = 0b1001001 ⊕ 0b1010111

Data Collection Using Raspberry Pi 3.0 and sensors using Python		1. IntroductionThe internet of things is a connected of various elements capable of communication with one another. Internet of Things utilize a variety of computing devices incuding sensors capabe of sensing parameters, communication devices that can interface the sensors to information convertors such as Analog to Digital convertors, and processing motherboard that can process data obtained from the sensors via the information convertors.2. Hardware RequirementsI have used the following hardware for this project. Illustration 1 depicts the components used for this project.3. Software RequirementsSoftware Used:Talk DescriptionThe ATMEGA328PU analog to digital convertor is bootloaded with data acquition bootloader available from the AVR too chain set.Here in this project, I have connected DHC11 temperature sensor to a ATMEGA328PU  which is powered by the Raspberry Pi 3.0. The DHC11 temperature sensor senses the temperature and the ATMEGA328PU  sends the collected data to Raspberry Pi 3.0. The Raspberry Pi 3.0 receives the data from the  ATMEGA328PU and displays a chart of the data against time. Verification of whether the temperature sensor DHC11 can acquire accurate temperature with the user varying the temperature near the sensor using a match stick or by sticking his/her finger on the temperature sensor DHC11.The data can further be used from the end user’s purposes such as indicating a surge in temperature, and or display heat maps.The software part of acquiring data is written entirely in Python. I wrote python programs that are capable of sending messages to mobiles and email address of particular people.5. Scope for future workThe data collected from the DHC11 can be used to develop home automation tools such as  gesture control modules that make home automation tools more interesting towards user centric automation.There is a lot of future work in terms of applications in fields of Media, Entertainment Systems, Infrastructure Management, Manufacturing, Medical and Health care Systems, Transportation, and Large Scale deployments. I have entirely used Open Source Software for the software requirements so that there are no issues to make the project available for the common good.

Deep Learning fundamentals in Python: Implementing MLPs, Convnets Recurrent Nets and Reinforcement algorithms from scratch		Writing a Neural Network is one thing and making its training fast is another. For the same reason, programming a Neural Network should ideally neither be tough (as in Theano) or abstract (as in Keras). However, we have to use these frameworks to speed up the training (they compile the code for the CPU/GPU). The talk here is concerned about how can we implement these neural networks without aid of any frameworks (except numpy or autograd at worst) , so that we can strip down the complexity and see how the algorithms actually run. Bare minimal code is devoid of any complexity or abstractions and hence  we can focus on the algorithm than the framework.Here is what we will walk through:Implementing  a Multi Layer Perceptron using Numpy. Highlighting stages like forward propogation, backprop, training testing.How is a Recurrent Neural Network different from simple MLP (Multi Layer Perceptron) ?Implementing a Recurrent Neural Network to remember sequences.How to backpropogate errors in a Convolution ?

Demystifying Python's Method Resolution Order		"This talk is based on the method resolution order which defines the ""class search path"" used by Python to search for the right method to use in classes having multi-inheritance.Brief Background: It all started with a post by Samuele Pedroni to the Python development mailing list on 1 Oct 2002. In his post, Samuele showed that the Python 2.2 method resolution order is not monotonic and he proposed to replace it with the C3 method resolution order. Guido agreed with his arguments and therefore now Python 2.3 uses C3.Hence, Python uses two algorithms for method resolution order. The Old MRO algorithm is very straight forward but the new one is not so easy to bring out. I will be discussing and explaining both the algorithm and I would also be talking a a bit about the background of this change and the benefits of new C3 Method Resolution Order."	There are no prerequisites for this talk, anyone who can write a class in python and have a basic idea of inheritance can easily follow this talk.	Amit Kumar is a Core Developer at SymPy.

Deploying your python backend with (almost) zero cost	Draft of the presentation. More code snippets will be added. And live code will be shows in the IDE and demo'ed.	Gone are the days when you had to provision and maintain servers full time and pay huge costs for it (even though it is idle 99% of the time). The world is going serverless where someone else takes care of running your code automatically whenever you want. AWS Lambda is one such service which runs your piece of code when an event occurs - could be an HTTP API call, a message put in a queue or a file put in an S3 bucket. And NO! This isn't the usual cloud servers where you pay for the full hour. You pay in multiples of 100ms intervals of when your code executes and don't even have to pay a dime if no execution occurs. I will be presenting a real world code with a hands-on demo of how you can easily deploy your python code - be it a simple script to process your log files or handle HTTP API requests to return JSON responses. I would also talk about where you can't use lambdas and also workaround for those use cases.Going serverless for most of your backend processes will save you lot of money, which is a real differentiator when it comes to pricing your products competitively.

Django Reduxed	Slies WIP	"Having a service oriented architecture in web projects require interfacing the
backend using a REST-ful interface. Building your website as a single page app
allows you to focus on building the API up front, rather than duplicating your
efforts to build a website and then replicating the functionality with an API.
With a single page app, your website can be constructed in much the same way as
a mobile app. Django and the Django REST Framework enabled my team to quickly
deliver a highly functional REST API that was customised to our unique needs.React is a great tool to keep UI organised, but won't keep
track of the data and state of application. Redux comes to rescue over here -
it defines a minimal but sufficiently powerful way of interacting with that state.
An action from the UI is combined with a simple JS object(state).
Redux helps developers manage the state and flow of data around an application.One of the strengths of redux is that everything is very explicit.
It eases out the process of managing the state and flow of data
around an application. Imagine tons of asynchronous actions without introducing
annoying UI bugs.The talk will be an introduction to all the moving parts. How and where does
Redux fit into the bigger picture of REST APIs and Client Side MVC, and how to
seamlessly introduce the goodness it brings to your django project.
We will also see some non obvious things that we had to deal while using redux.Specifically we will address the following"	Attendees should be aware of the concept of SPAs.

Ensemble Models	"Ensemble Package (Link)
https://github.com/unnati-xyz/ensemble-package"	It is relatively easy to build a first-cut machine learning model. But what does it take to build a reasonably good model, or even a state-of-art model ?Ensemble models. They are our best friends. They help us exploit the power of computing. Ensemble methods aren’t new. They form the basis for some extremely powerful machine learning algorithms like random forests and gradient boosting machines. The key point about ensemble is that consensus from diverse models are more reliable than a single source. This talk will cover how we can combine model outputs from various base models to create a stronger/better model output.This talk will cover various strategies to create ensemble models.Using third-party Python libraries along with scikit-learn, this talk will demonstrate the following ensemble methodologies: 1) Weighted Average 2) Stacking 3)BlendingReal-life examples from the enterprise world will be show-cased where ensemble models produced better results consistently when compared against single best-performing models.We at Unnati Data Labs have built a package for performing the ensembling of machine learning models.The motivation was to incorporate the various techniques described into a single python package. The current version of the package has the power to perform weighted averaging, and build stacking and blending models for binary classification. The other ensembling techniques will be incorporated in the future. The package enables data encoding, the desired data on which the user wishes to classify the data, can be encoded in many different ways like label encoding (categorical encoding), one hot encoding, sum encoding, polynomial encoding, backward difference encoding, helmert encoding, and hashing encoding. The encoded data will then be used to train the base models. The package provides the user with the ability to build a number of base models such as Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Multi Layer Perceptron, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression. The user can build any or all the base models with default parameter values, change the parameter values or provide a list of parameter values to perform hyper parameter optimistaion (Using Hyperopt and Grid Search) and identify the optimum parameter values. Once the desired parameter values have been obtained the respective base models will be trained. Upon training the models, the trained models are used to obtain predictions on the cross validation data, these predictions obtained from the base models will be used to construct a data frame, which will be used to train the stacking and blending models, and perform weighted averaging.Once the base models have been trained the user can select which ensembling technique to use. The dataframe of predictions will be used to perform weighted averaging, the same dataframe will be used to train the stacking model, for training the blending model the dataframe of predictions will be appended with the cross validation data. To train the ensemble models the algorithm or classifier which will be used can be any of the algorithms/classifiers provided for the training of the base models. For testing the stacking and blending models we can hold out a test set which can be used to examine how well these ensemble models perform, wether they overfit, underfit, provide better performance than the base models.Why this package stands out? First of, the package enables data encoding which provides more flexibility and information which can imporve the performance of the models. The package utilizes hyperopt and gridsearch to perform hyper parameter optimization, so at the time of training the models, we have the optimum parameter values which yields improved performance. Since ensembling involves building and training multiple models with the option of performing hyper parameter optimization, time taken to train these models becomes an issue. To tackle this issue the package makes use of the joblib library for parallelization. With the help of joblib, the various base models are trained in parallel, also the predictions on the cross validation data are obtained by running the predict functions in parallel. For the ensemble models the training of the different ensemble models are done in parallel, so is the testing phase of the ensemble models. This has enabled for a fast, robust, well defined package with immense potential in the world of machine laeenring.The package is still in its primary stage, and will continue to be worked upon. Some of the key areas to work on will be adding more base models as well as different ensembling techniques and also expanding to regression, multi class classification and more.Creating better models is the critical component of building a good data science product.

Standard web application firewalls can help detect these Bots, but only basis of predefined rules/rates.
Using map/reduce and analyzing access logs, we try to analyze behavioral patterns of a user and address them as bots, or a suspicious user and throw alerts for the same.Framework is divided into 2 parts:-
1. Data Acquisition and Log Parsing
2. Machine learning and training model for anomaly findingPart 1 
Talking about simply plugging in and hooking up logs from various systems into our system, parsing them to get required enrichment fields.Part 2
Feeding these logs into spark for machine learning, providing training sets of good/bad data and making use cases basis of user requirement. We would be briefly talking about the architecture, and then moving onto show casing some use cases, and showing the plug-ability of new use cases. 
Our idea is to have this completely framework driven, where logs can simply be achieved by setting up a listener via fluent. Even Machine learning use cases have been made completely configurable where we can simply plugin any use case basis of config files and driver driven machine learning codes. 
So designing a use case won't take more than 10-15 minutes.Since rule based detection and alerting any web application firewall can do we have moved away from rule based anomaly detection and letting the system learn itself basis of machine learning algorithms and thereby producing anomalies which would mean, any deviation from normal behavior rather than only certain rule based triggering, which any web application firewall would do.We would be ending off, by providing challenges faced during our journey and how we overcame those issues, throughput that we have seen in our system, and our ideal response time to take care of any anomaly.Our goal, helping a tech driven company like Makemytrip to quickly identify any anomalies that have occurred in the least amount of time, thereby boosting business.

While GTK+ is developed by the GNOME foundation and has great support for Linux, QT seems to be a more popular choice since its applications can be ported to far varied platforms than GTK. What I find compelling about GTK+ is that ""A chair() is still a chair()"". What I mean is that the GTK+ API comes very naturally to a beginner without having to remember special names. The very name of the classes and their inheritance model is easily understandable.If you follow the link to sample programs under ""Content urls"", you will find the codes there really simple and generic.

Learn to use cryptography library	https://github.com/hackertron/cryptographyhttps://cryptography.io/en/latest/	"cryptography is a package which provides cryptographic recipes and primitives to Python developers. Our goal is for it to be your ""cryptographic standard library"". It supports Python 2.6-2.7, Python 3.3+, and PyPy 2.6+.cryptography includes both high level recipes, and low level interfaces to common cryptographic algorithms such as symmetric ciphers, message digests and key derivation functions. For example, to encrypt something with cryptography's high level symmetric encryption recipe .Why a new crypto library for Python?
If you’ve done cryptographic work in Python before, you’ve probably seen some other libraries in Python, such as M2Crypto, PyCrypto, or PyOpenSSL. In building cryptography we wanted to address a few issues we observed in the existing libraries:Lack of PyPy and Python 3 support.
Lack of maintenance.
Use of poor implementations of algorithms (i.e. ones with known side-channel attacks).
Lack of high level, “Cryptography for humans”, APIs.
Absence of algorithms such as AES-GCM and HKDF.
Poor introspectability, and thus poor testability.
Extremely error prone APIs, and bad defaults."	Must know either python 2.7 or 3 . Should have a basic understanding of what is cryptography !!

We will begin by breifly overviwing the features of the NLTK library, and then we will try to develop a language aware data product using a a topic identification and document clustering algorithm from a web crawl of blog sites.
The clustering algorithm will use a simple Lesk K-Means clustering to start, and then will improve with an LDA analysis.The NLTK library exists with a pre-existing set of definitions and a means of work flow. By studying this we will get a feel for the various features and functionality that NLTK has to offer. But since everyone has very diversified requirements, therefore during the later part of the session we will build a topic identification and document clustering algorithm from a web crawl of blog sites using NLTK in a codelab.

Managing a distributed, heterogeneous Git mirror network	Slides will be finalised at a later date.	At KDE, our git server infrastructure consists of one master git server that accepts pushes, a network of read-only anongit servers, and a GitHub organisation which hosts another read-only copy of our repositories.We typically need to create new repos, rename and move existing ones, and finally delete unused repos. All of these operations have to played on our master server, the anongit mirrors and to whatever extent possible, our GitHub org. We have to keep the mirrors in sync, poke CI when all the mirrors are up-to-date, and notify the admins when something goes wrong. Managing all of this is a big task, especially when networks are bad, servers don't sync and daemons crash.To solve this problem, what started out as a set of ad-hoc scripts became a full blown piece of server software built to manage a fleet of git mirrors. In this talk, we'll describe how we use Python, Redis, Tornado and other libraries, with a home grown task queue, to solve all of our problems.	Knowledge of basic Python is required. An intermediate level of knowledge about Git is beneficial, but not necessary.	Boudhayan Gupta: Boudhayan is a developer and system administrator for KDE.

Measuring Semantic Similarity between sentences in Python		"The talk will cover a set of approaches to measure semantic similarity between phrases. Concretely, consider the following sentences. ""Harry is running fast"" and ""Harry is Sprinting"". Traditional word-matching algorithms fail to capture the semantic overlap between such phrases. Such similarity scores form essential parts of systems for Information Retrieval (IR), Question Answering, Automatic Grading and several other Natural Language Processing applications. 
The talk will also briefly discuss a Propositional Logic Generation System (PLGS) that converts sentences in natural language to their propositional logic representations. 
For instance, the sentence ""Harry is running fast"" would be represented as:-
 - obj(Harry, o1)
 - run(o1, e1)
 - prop(e1, fast)
in propositional logic. Such propositions form the bedrock of powerful reasoning systems for question answering and Information Retrieval.

The MicroPython board is a small electronic circuit board that runs MicroPython on the bare metal, and gives you a low-level Python operating system that can be used to control all kinds of electronic projects. Running an interpreter based programming language in a microprocessor with an OS is considered to be easier than running a the same in a microcontroller environment ,where you won't get the luxury of the RAM (System memory) and available ROM ( It can be flash or EEPROM etc.).In the most modern microcontrollers with ARM Cortex M4 or even M7 series the RAM is limited to few hundred kiloBytes and Flash will be few MegaBytes.

2) Decrease running time on GPU
3) Increase performance in case of very little data  There will be a few strategies taught which will allow the neural networks to train and run much faster on CPUs without compromising on the accuracy. A few of them will be changing the neural network itself, which others will focus more on using tools to enhance performance. I have ran very deep neural networks in real-time on CPUs using some of the techniques which will presented. The latter half of the talk will be focused on increasing performance in case there is very little data. I have personally achieved accuracies of above 90% using Deep Neural Networks when there are only a few hundreds of images available as training data. I'll be sharing some of those intuitions in this talk, including concepts like initialization, normalization, tweaking the learning rate, regularization, when to finetune and when not to etc. The whole talk will be focused on using Python to run Deep Neural Networks using the Theano/Keras library, which is the most popular deep learning library and is used widely by amateurs and professionals alike. It will not be a theoretical talk where I talk about theories to achieve something. I'll demonstrate how changing certain parameters (variables in Keras) change the performance in terms of speed, accuracy and size of model"	Necessary :  1) An understanding of how DCNNs work  2) A background on Machine Learning  Recommended :   1)  Knowledge of Keras since the demos will be shown using this.

Travis CI, Jenkins etcCI or Continuous integration is a practice which actually helps the developers to test their features with respect to integrating
it with the project. It actually tells the developers if the changes the made to the code base is stable or not. Jenkins is an integration management system (CI) used by most of the apps in fedora for automated testing and integration. fedmsg (Fedora-Messaging) is a python package and API used around Fedora Infrastructure to send and receive messages to and from applications.The need arose when a pull request to Pagure is merged and it cause the build to fail. We need to find out which pull request cause the build to fail. The whole gist is to attach a build report to each pull request so that we know the status of the Jenkins build looking at the pull request.Jenkins service act as the intermediate node between the ""pull request"" and the ""Jenkins"". Now whenever a pull request is merged it informs the Jenkins service. Now the build is being monitored continuously to find out the build status. When the build status is generated the service takes the status and attach it to the particular pull request.

Put that SWAG in your API - SWAGGERIZE it	Get to know about Swagger from here	Everyone is making and consuming REST API's now a days as it's simple to consume and doesn't carry the bells and whistles like earlier complex technologies like SOAP. The Bells and whistles though at one point ensured that both client and server were tightly integrated with the help of sharable schema definitions by server to the clients. Swagger brings the similar kind of experience but in a much simple way to the REST API's, it helps generate the API Documentation on the fly that one can share with the clients. So lets SWAGGERize our API's and learn how to implement Swagger with Python as well as other Language based REST APIs.The talk will first focus on drawing a parallel between the SOA implementations like CORBA or .net webservices/remoting and REST API's and why everyone moved from complex implementations to simplistic REST API implementation and how the tenets of SOA were shaken during this process. Second part of the talk will introduce the Swagger and tools that are part of Swagger suite, It can be overwhelming at times to see how these tools fit together and work with multiple platforms at the same time, we'll see the underlying architecture of Swagger and see how each tool fits in.Third part - Shows a python demo where we will make and break a REST API written in python and generate its documentation and generate its clients (in multiple languages) as quickly as possible as part of the release process	REST APIs	"I am a Sr. Technology Evangelist (Open Source solutions) with Microsoft.

PyProfound :  How to train the best machine learning model with zero lines of code ?	https://github.com/SurukamAnalytics/pyprofound	Building a machine learning model is easy but getting that elusive 1 percent increase in precision/recall when you are already in the high nineties is as frustrating as it is to watch Sachin bat through his 90s.The sheer abundance of available algorithms and their hyperparameters becomes apparent when we look at the number of papers being submitted to the machine learning related sections of arXiv on any given day [1] . This makes sifting through the various combinations of algorithm-parameters a work of a seasoned professional.Adding to the complexity in finding the best machine learning model for your particular use-case, is the prerequisite of knowing any of the myriad data-science centric programming languages like Python, R or Julia and a knowledge of extracting the best features from the available dataset. Pre-processing the data to handle missing values, categorical features and columns with low information content becomes as important as the algorithm you have chosen.PyProfound is an open-source desktop application built using electron.js and Python, that takes a dataset of your choice and returns a machine learning model which scores the best on cross-validation among all combinations possible on Scikit-Learn. The feature extraction module automatically generates natural language features like part-of-speech tags, named entities in the case of textual data. In our algorithm to search for the best model, we also plan to compare the parsing output from the most popular open-source text parsers available such as Stanford’s CoreNLP, Python NLTK, SpaCy and Google’s Parsey McParseface. There would soon be a bot interface to the application as well, which would make the application much easier to use — it would seem like you are being guided by a machine learning expert on the other end.During the talk, we will explain how the application runs through a battery of pre-processing steps and performs a grid-search like operation on the feature vectors to find the one true classifier.	No programming knowledge required — it is a GUI after all. Anyone with a data science use-case, but without the necessary know-how can attend this session. Although, it’s good to have some statistics or basic machine learning knowledge. 	I am a 4th year undergraduate student at IIT Kharagpur. I contributed to PyProfound as a part of my internship at Surukam Analytics. I am very enthusiastic about machine learning in general and natural language processing in particular —  it has driven all my attention and focus towards it.

I wanted to take the ideas behind the recipe to a wider audience. I did a couple of talks on the recipe first, and found that people were excited, but found it hard to digest. Later on, I refined the talk to take a step-by-step approach, that provides the required background to understand the recipe, resulting in the current form of the talk."

works. Specifically we will be looking at how to decipher the generated
code objects and the associated byte code, using a poke and learn
approach.The objective of the talk is to show people how interpreters in

implemented. While this is not really required for people to use the

If you are not aware of these gotchas, you might conclude that the language is poorly designed when you come across it in production.
Some cases are intentional but can be surprising, for exampleIt might seem strange at first glance, but it makes more sense once you are aware of the underlying
reasons for the surprises.

Real time Sentiment Analysis with Apache Storm and Python	https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6nwjmOC5sCGMGx2bWh1NWVmblE/view?usp=sharinghttps://github.com/apache/stormhttp://hortonworks.com/apache/storm/	Data is everywhere. How much data can we process in real time? How twitter is managing this huge data? This talk will help in understanding Big Data better. Twitter uses Apache Storm. Take a dive into Apache storm and learn more about Twitter Sentiment Analysis in Real Time. This will help you get started with Apache Storm with one use case of Sentiment Analysis. This talk will be very basic and intends to motivate the attendees towards Apache Storm and help them to understand Apache Storm better. Apache Storm can process tens of thousands of messages in a second, and if properly configured it can process millions in a second. But we shall be using some dump of twitter tweets and use it for sentiment Analysis with simple Heuristics. And if time permits we will use tweepy library to get real time streaming from twitter.I shall be using Petrel (a Python Library) to submit the Storm topologies that we together build in our talk session. If time permits, setting up of Apache Storm shall be demoed and run the sample Topology.

Sampling From Streams: Reservoir Sampling & VIRBs	http://tech.magnetic.com/2016/04/virbs-sampling-events-from-streams.html	Those of us who use Python to build systems that ingest constant streams of incoming data (which includes anybody whose code touches the internet) often need algorithms that keep a fixed-size sample from the stream for on-the-fly analytics. At Magnetic we are engaged in real-time bidding for online advertising, which also requires extremely low-latency Python code.Reservoir sampling is a commonly used algorithm for keeping a sample that's unbiased over all events in the stream. But what if you want your algorithm to keep a representative sample from the past 10 minutes instead of the entire stream?In this talk I'll start with a gentle introduction to reservoir sampling for those who are not familiar with it, and then discuss several variants that keep samples which are biased towards more recent events. One of these is the VIRB (Variable Incoming Rate Biased) sampler, which we have developed in-house at Magnetic.	The audience should be able to read and understand basic Python code. No background is required in Statistics or sampling algorithms, but it might make the talk more interesting.

Scaling Django with Kubernetes		"It has always been advised to architect our apps to both scale, fault/load tolerance and be resilient 
to arbitrary failure.  Most services are implemented as a container under the hood. Traditionally,
you would deploy django to some virtual machine instance.  PaaS has been the buzz word for quite 
sometime now, and is paving way for CaaS - Container as a Service. Containers, most often use Docker 
to produce immutable, isolated and quick to sign up application images.With containers there have been few known challenges:How do multiple containers talk to each other?How do I horizontally scale my container service?How do multiple container services discover each other?How do we secure our container network?How do we deploy new containers and roll back previous ones?To answer the above problems and address the issue of orchestration, scheduling and other automation tasks Kubernets 
was released by Google. This talk is going to be about how we can use Docker containers and Kubernetes
to help our production Django web application to be scalable, secure and fault tolerant.The ideas expressed in the workshop are not tied closely to Django, they can very easily be extrapolated to a 
cluster design consisting of web server, database server, load balancer and other standard components.
Django just happens to be one amongst  the most popular python web frameworks, which accounts for its selection. Specifically we will look into the following list during our workshop : "	You should be well aware of django or any other popular web framework, and should have pushed a web app to public usage.

We will be covering these points in the session:Store and Process real world networks using different formatsAnalyze properties of real world networksAnalyze properties of the network at node levelIdentify Meso-Scale structures in real world networks such as, Facebook Network, Citation Network, etc.Epidemic Models to explain Information diffusion, opinion dynamics, and so on.Motivation:In this workshop, we will motivate students towards the use of python in network science and how we can make some quick inferences from real world complex datasets using networkx library. We will cover all the functions provided by the library and how these functions can be modified a little bit to get more information with less effort. We will also be explaining, what all properties can be studied using inbuilt functions, and when it is required to write your own code with the help of given library. We will also include a small component to explain the comparison of networkx library with other available libraries, so that users can pick the best one based on their requirements.In the end, we will share some sample codes that will help to analyze networks structure, its properties, and dynamic phenomenon taking place on real world networks, like how information diffusion happens in real world networks and how it can be visualized with a small piece of code. Some more examples like: How we can detect community structure using partial information of the network, how we can analyze the correlation of network properties, and so on. As we have also observed with interns (specially undergraduate students), they are not aware of these quick libraries and how these libraries can help them in getting good understanding of science happening in complex networks. Through this workshop, We would like to motivate them and to explain them that the handling of real world networks is not so complex and even a small piece of code can help them getting better results. We will also share real world datasets so that attendees can use it to perform analysis.

We will show basics of constructing and manipulating mathematical expressions in SymPy, the most common issues and differences from other computer algebra systems, and how to deal with them. We will mostly show how to solve practical problems with SymPy and SymEngine. This will include showing how to interface SymPy with popular numeric libraries like NumPy.Attendees will take home an introductory level understanding of SymPy. This knowledge should be enough for attendees to start using SymPy for solving mathematical problems and hacking SymPy's internals (though hacking core modules may require additional expertise).SymPy is a pure Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python and does not require any external libraries. The tutorial will cover the following topics and more.	The tutorial will only assume a basic knowledge of Python. No prior knowledge of SymPy or other Python libraries is required, although it is suggested that attendees be familiar with the IPython notebook. A mathematical knowledge of calculus is recommended.We recommend that the attendees install the Anaconda Python distribution which includes SymPy, NumPy, and IPython.

Talking to Machines : Optimizing Neural Networks with Theano		"With recent advances in the field of Deep Learning, computers have become much better at challenging human level  tasks. And these are no longer restricted to detecting objects, or learning languages. Visual Question Answering, is one such interesting area of research where machines can learn to answer questions from images, by training Deep Neural Networks. 
For instance,



    Is the dog sleeping?

And while some of this often looks like 'black box' magic, we lose sight of the fact that the ideas are based on extensive research with rigorous mathematical foundation. The talk aims at introducing some of these concepts through Theano, a Python library, extensively used just not in the Deep Learning community, but the scientific community generally. In the discussion, we delve deeper into optimizing Deep Neural Network architectures with Theano, with focus on the VQA task mentioned above. This helps exploring how several state-of-the-art approaches like Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs) come together in an architecture to develop interesting algorithms."

Functional programming is a programming paradigm wherein computation is treated as evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. A regular programmer can use a lot of constructs inspired by the functional paradigm and Python supports the same. The talk will be focussed on a practical programmer's view of adapting to functional programming rather than abstract functional technique.

Many of us blame python for being slow. Ever thought it's not python's fault all of those times. May be it's our code that is at fault. It is useless trying to blindly optimize a program without measuring where it is actually spending its time. There are many things that can be measured on our code. This talk will focus on profiling different parts of your program like line by line analysis, memory used by each objects, memory leaks, objects that causes these memory leaks, etc. The profiling and analysis will be done using python standard libraries and also using some open source libraries.When you walk out of this talk, you would be a better programmer and appreciate the finer details of python.

Token based Authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Token)		"JWT is standard for making authentication token. JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and encrypted.Unlike session based authentication, Token based authentication system takes very less load of server. In session based authentication system, maintaining of session storage is requires processing and storage. While as Token based authentication system, it is not required to maintain session storage at server side. Tone of processing and storage will be saved. Beauty of using JWT as authentication token is it's simplicity. Once token is created, it is possible to authenticate user without touching the database again. Token can be discarded when it is expired by time from the expire time mentioned in token itself. The JWT is self contained token which has authentication, expire time information and any other user defined claims digitally signed. JWT can be used to provide Token Based Authentication system at your ReST API. Because JWT is self contained with required claims it is possible to scale API without depending on Authentication server. Oauth 2.0 uses JWT as token exchange standard. Using JWT is simple and more efficient when we have to design authentication system for our internal client who are not user of any Oauth provider like Gmail, Facebook etc. OAuth 2.0 contains many payload values which increase token size and it requires time to transfer where as using JWT, it is possible to get small size token with best security as Oauth 2.0By Jaysinh ShuklaRole: Full stack developerGithub:1 http://github.com/ultimatecoder2 http://github.com/jsh-odooTwitter: @jaysinhpEmail: jaysinhp@gmail.comIRC: thebigjClient sends authentication credentials (username and password) to Server.Server verifies authentication credentialsClient stores session id probably at Cookie storage. This id
  is sent by client with every request. And from that session id user is
  identified further.This allows to identified the same user from upcoming request without
  re asking user credentials.Difficult to handle with

  hashing algorithm.Revoking access of specific Token by deactivating record at token

Header, Claim set and Signature.Each part of authentication token is encoded with
  base64url encoding and separated with "".""The token is containing three different part separated with "".""Each part is encoded with base64url encoding.The first part the .red[Red Part] is JOSE HeaderThe second part the .blue[Blue Part] is JWT Claim setThe third part the .green[Green Part] is JWT SignatureBase64URL(JOSE Header).Base64URL(JWT Claims).Base64URL(JWT Signature)Decoded with Base64 encoding:{

  to next 3 days and user is logged out after 1 day, that token can be
  used by attacker for that unused 2 days and API will consider Token as
  valid.As a best practice, set expiry time not longer than 10 minutes!As a good practice keep less values in claim. Adding many claims may

would like to improve their skills, by learning how to write professional

a field of landmines. Python's dynamic nature allows typos in variable

specific input drives it through the erroneous code path. Integration
testing be it manual or automated is insufficient and can at times
be frustating for Python code.Fortunately Python's own standard library makes it easy to write unit
test cases, by providing the needed infrastructure. Through this
workshop we would like to make a strong case for unit testing, and
then show how to use the available frameworks for writing test
cases. We will also cover how dependencies can be isolated using
mocking and faking. We then move beyond writing test cases and cover

Web development with Django and MongoDB	1 - https://www.djangoproject.com/2 - https://www.mongodb.org/3 - http://mongoengine.org/4 - https://github.com/raakeshkumar/pycon-demo	MongoDB is a No-SQL database and very popular these days. The purpose of this workshop is to provide information as to how we can use it in Django as the common installation process is very old and not sync with the latest Django. So in this workshop, we will cover how can we use Mongo Engine ORM in our Django Application.Following topics will be covered in this workshop:Django Basics : Basic Introduction to Model, View, Template, and ORMMongo DB basics : Introduction to MongoDB, Document Model, Queries and Comparision with RDBMSMongo Engine ORM :  Introduction, Creating Models and using it in views. Code ExamplesIntegration of Mongo Engine in Django : Changing database settings and replacing it with MongoEngine.Sample Application: https://github.com/raakeshkumar/pycon-demoA presentation to cover these topics in detail.	1 - You should have knowledge about basic python(2.7). Dive into Python book can be good way to start.2 - I will be using Ubuntu to demonstrate the codes so you should be aware of Linux OS(any distribution).3 - You should come django and mongoDB installed.
